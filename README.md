interactive form unit 3
In this project I took a basic webform and used js to add inner activity and enhanced usability. 
The code wriitern checks various feilds to make sure it contains the correct information, ansd display an error indication if it doesnt. 
The code should automaticaly focus on the first text field when the form loads. 
As the user completing the form makes selections parts of the form is automatically updated. 
An example of this is as the user the chooses a design for the t-shirt the color will automatically be seledted. 
while the user registers for activities in the conference the total cost will display below the list of activities, as well when a conflicting activity is selected the conflicting activity is greyed out. 
If the form is submitted without valid information the required field will highlight red.
